# Feats
- Custom Engine
- Custom Sounds
- Fully Server sync using Onesync state bags
- Cleaned and optimized and removed all the useless functions.
- Create a new zone using the command ```/createzone``` in the game
- View a list of all zones using the command ```/zonelist```
- Each zone has its own authorized job
- You can make it so only bosses of the jobs can engine swap
- You can add more zones for more mechanic shops

# Install
- Installation:
